# Vectors are defined as a list of 2 or 3 numbers.
# The numbers represent the coordinates of the vectors tip .
# All vectors are assumed to start at origin [0, 0, 0].
#      X  Y  Z
V1 = [-1, 2, 0]
V2 = [ 2, 4, 0]

# Addition of vectors ; using tip to tail method
V3 = [1, 2, 0]
W1 = [3, -1, 0]
V3plW1 = [4, 1, 0] # sum of vectors V3 + W1 ; [x1 + x2, y1 + y2, z1 + z2]

# Multiplication by a number
